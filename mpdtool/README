=========================== mpdtool - a program to communicate with MPD and with Betty ===========================

1. Copy this directory to a computer on which you want to have the scart adapter installed.
	
2. call "make clean && make all" to create the program "mpdtool"

3. call ./mpdtool <serial_device> <serverHost> <serverPort>
	where serial device is the device where your scart adapter is connected
	serverHost is the computer on which MPD is running
	and serverPort is the TCP/IP port of MPD
	Example: "./mpdtool /dev/ttyS0 localhost 6600"

mpdtool now gets commands from Betty via scart adapter, sends them to MPD via TCP/IP and 
	returns the answers of MPD to Betty via scart.

mpdtool should give meaningful error messages if something goes wrong.
