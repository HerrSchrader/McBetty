Source code and binary for Music player Client for Betty.

To compile the source resulting in muc_rom.bin:
   make

To flash Betty with the firmware (serial flash connection over /dev/ttyUSB0):

Currently implemented:
- Shows current title and artist, volume, current playtime and total playtime.
- Shows status (play, pause, stop).

- McBetty has 3 screens. The keys can have different functions in each screen:
	The playlist screen gives a scrollable list of playlists.
	<Cursor up/down> or <Prog+/Prog-> scroll to a playlist,
	<OK> selects that playlist.
	<Exit> leaves the screen without selecting anything.
	We are currently limited to 30 playlists.

	The tracklist screen shows all tracks in the current playlist.
	<Cursor up/down> or <Prog+/Prog-> scroll to a track,
	<Exit> leaves the screen without selecting anything.
	<OK> selects that track to play.
 
	The playing screen shows information about the currently playing track.
	<Prog+/-> selects the next/previous track.
	<Cursor Left/Right> skips backward/forward a few seconds in the current track.
	<Volume+/-> increase/decrease the volume.
	<Mute> toggles the volume to and from 0.
	<Green> start playing.
	<Yellow> toggles pause.
	<Red> stops playing.
	<PiP> toggles the "Random" mode.
	<A/B> toggles the "Repeat" mode.
	<16:9> toggles the "Single" mode (if version of MPD supports it)
