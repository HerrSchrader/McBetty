/* Our radio transmit output data buffer has the following semantics:
	- We put data bytes in sequentially
	- The buffer is organizing them automatically into packets suitable for radio transmission
	- buf[bufstart] is 0, if no data payload bytes are in buffer, i.e. buffer empty
	- buf[bufstart] is n with n<0, if n payload bytes are in buffer, but packet is not complete yet
	- buf[bufstart] is n (with n>0), if complete packet with n payload bytes is in buffer
	- buf[bufstart] is only valid when we are not currently transferring bytes out of the buffer to TXFIFO

	The buffer is used to store data bytes before we send them to cc1100 because we do not know the packet size
	in advance.
	We can get quite long answers from MPD and there is a small delay each time we send a packet 
	(transfering to CC110, calibration etc. ), so we have to tell mpdtool when we are ready to receive more
	bytes. 

	We can concurrently put bytes in the buffer (via serial_isr) and read them out via buffer_out().
	The buffer is filled via interrupt, but the main program has to know when we have received an

	/* This is a state machine with the variable mode as the state variable 
		We have 2 main modes: 	
			cmd_mode means we are receiving a command via radio from Betty
				We then send this command to MPD via serial line
			response_mode means we are getting an answer from MPD via serial line
				We send this answer via radio to Betty
	
		Communication over serial line is no problem. It is full duplex, so sending and receiving
		can occur simultaneously and independently.
	
		But the radio link is half duplex. We can only send or receive but not both simultaneously.
		So we have to know when to switch between sending and receiving.
		The application is a server/client application.
		The client (Betty) sends a request, the server answers.
		The server (currently) never sends bytes without a previous request.
		In each case only the sender knows, when his transmission is finished.
		(The requests have different length, as well as the answers).
		But we can assume that requests and answers are finished within a short time frame,
		say 1.5 seconds after communication has started.
		So we implement a protocol, where the current sender finishes his message with a unique byte
		that does not normally occur in the message, in this case EOT.
		So, in this loop when an EOT is seen, the following happens:
			cmd_mode: drop EOT, Reset radio_RX buffer, reset radio_TX buffer, Switch to sending mode
			response_mode: Flush radio_TX buffer, send EOT over radio, reset radio_RX buffer, switch to receiving mode 
	
		The next complication is that the processor has a very limited RAM (256 Bytes) and the server may send very long 
		responses.
		We can only buffer a small amount and have to inform the server when the serial line can not receive
		more bytes. This is done via ETX and ACK bytes.
		The server (MPD) sends only small portions of data (16 bytes) at a time and then sends an ETX.
		If we still have room for more data, we send back an ACK character over serial line.
		Else we wait until part of our buffer has been sent out over radio link and is free again.
	
	
		We should implement a simple main loop here.
		Within the loop some tasks are called, which all return relatively fast (say 10 ms or shorter).
		That way we create the illusion of multitasking.
	
		Task 1: check_etx
			Checks if we got an ETX character. If we have room in our radio-tx-buffer, we send an ACK. 
			Takes less than 0.3 ms, even if serial TX is busy.
	
		Task 2: handle_radio_tx
			If there is a packet in our radio-tx-buffer ready to be sent (either because max packet length is 
				reached or because EOT was received)
				Move bytes from radio-tx-buffer to CC1100 TXFIFO.
				If all bytes have been moved to CC1100 FIFO and CC1100 is ready, strobe CC1100 to start sending.
	
		Task 3: receive bytes via radio
			when a complete packet has been received via radio, send the bytes to serial out. 
			When we have seen an EOT, mark the CC1100 as ready for TX.
