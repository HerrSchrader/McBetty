Source code to produce the scart image firmware for McBetty.

There are 2 ways to flash the scart adapter with the required firmware for McBetty:
1. 
	When there is already a boot loader in the scart adapter
	This is probably only the case if you have already flashed a previous version of McBetty firmware to scart adapter.
	But it does no harm to try anyway.
	
	Use "cd scart_image && make clean && make all" to generate scart_image.h and scart_image.bin and the necessary tools.
	Connect the scart adapter over serial line to the computer.
	Power up the scart adapter.

	Just call "flashtool /dev/ttyS0" if the scart adapter is connected to the serial port directly
	or call "flashtool /dev/ttyUSB0" if the scart adapter is connected over a serial-to-usb converter. 
 
	In doubt, just try it. Will do nothing if the boot loader is not already in scart firmware.

2.
	The program flashtool does not work with a brand new scart adapter or one where a version of the boop firmware has been flashed to.

	In thoses cases there is no serial boot loader in the scart adapter firmware, so you have to follow these steps:
	Build a cable to connect Betty with the scart adapter. Do NOT connect it now.
	Connect Betty to the computer.
	Use "cd scart_image && make clean && make all" 
	Use "cd boop.orig && make resident" to flash a special version of boop to Betty
	Disconnect Betty from computer.
	Start up Betty.
	In the main menu of Betty, select "tools" and then "Scart_ICP"
	Follow the instructions given by Betty.
	The new image is flahsed to scart adapter.

	The boot loader is included in the image, so these steps need to be done only once.
	(When the boot loader (i.e. flashtool) does not work, try flashing from Betty again).

	Then flash Betty with the McBetty firmware!
