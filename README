================= McBetty (Music Client for Betty) =====================

Binaries and source code. Everything under GPL.

HOWTO:

1. Set up a computer wich runs MPD.
	Test it with a normal client (mpc works fine).

2. Flash the scart adapter with a new firmware.
	See the README in "scart_image" directory.

3. Flash Betty with the McBetty firmware.
	See the README in "muc" directory.

4. Install the program "mpdtool" on a computer on which you have network access  
	to MPD and to which you want to connect the scart adapter.
	See README in "mpdtool" directory.

5. Start up Betty and enjoy the music.
